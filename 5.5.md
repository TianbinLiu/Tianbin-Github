> ### GitHub pages action
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages. <br>
* The license I chose is CC0(Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal). It is open source which means anyone can use my code in GitHub page without cost(no patents).

2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why. <br>
* Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, because I think no one will pay for my GitHub page so there is no different to be open source or not. That why I chose CC0.
