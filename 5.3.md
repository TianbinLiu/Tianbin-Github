Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation. <br>
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases. <br>
Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development. <br>

* Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
* Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
* * Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
No, it doesn't.
* * If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
Because the title of the Youtube video is called the PCs are racist not the programmer. And he also said in the video that his blackness is interfering with the computer's ability and it's not intentional.
* * How do you think this happened?
I think it's because the program inside the software had determine different treatments based on what color of the face. If the software find out the face was black then it will not follow the movement of the face, I think it was intentional.
* * Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Yes, this is harmful. And it was intened to be harmful.
* * Should it be corrected?
Of cause it should be corrected.
* * What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
Delete the intentional code they produced.
