### 5.4 Crowdsourcing

* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. <br>

* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet. <br>

* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing. <br>

* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding. <br>
