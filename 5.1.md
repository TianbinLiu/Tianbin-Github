### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects
People create computing innovations <br>
The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations <br>
Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance. <br>
A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. <br>
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts. <be>

**Accelerometers** <br>
* Automobile industry drove price down
* * Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection

**Multirotor** <br>
	* Benefit - Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy
	* Harmful - flying  in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy concerns.

**Wii controller** <br>
	* Benefit - Gets people active playing video games
	* Harmful - Broken TVâ€™s and injuries

**3D Printers** <br>
* Open-source software for the computer and printer
* In schools and homes
* * New classes developed for 3D printing
* Special 3D printers can make
* * Organs/Prosthetics
* * Houses
* * Shoes and jewelry
* * Themselves

Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended. <br>
Originally intended: <br>
* The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community.
* Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
* Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways tier computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses. <br>
It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer. <be>

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing <br>
* Beneficial: 
* * Information passes quickly, less propaganda. 
* * Easier to search information, more ways to gain information. 
* * Easier to contact others.
* Harmful: 
* * Wrong information also passes quickly, hard to dispel rumors. 
* * More ways to send fake news and rumors, hard to find and prove real information. 
* * Less time to meet with others face by face, most on the cellphone.

> 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? <br>
* Internet is just a tool, which effects take to people is depending on what they do. Not only Internet can cause dopamine, for people who like sports, sports produce dopamine. For people who like to study, studying produces dopamine. If a child was deep on Internet, it may be because his parents may show a bad example for him like they also used the Internet a lot. Or his parents don't give enough accompany and teach to him so that the child was deep on the Internet not on sports or other habits.
