### 5.2 Digital Divide
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries. <br>
The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics. <br>
The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals. <br>
The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally. <br>
The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments. <br>
Demographics include, but not isolated to: <br>
* Age
* Religion

> ### GitHub pages action -- Digital Empowerment
* How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
* * By limiting other's access of Internat (having the control of Internat).

* How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* * By helping them search the things they wanted. Or helping them to empower themself. Like at Del Norte HS, people who have their own PC can help people who have Chromebook.

* Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* * In some cause, it does, when I searched something about like how to add video background on Github Page and tried to open some of the links, it showed that the school wifi had blocked the link, so I need to figure out by myself.
