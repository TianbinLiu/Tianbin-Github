# Caesar Cipher
* If you want to prevent a person from quickly decoding and reading an intercepted notes, you can substitute one letter for another. This is an example of encryption, which is accomplished by the transposition of one letter to another.
* Consider how you might shift characters to send a secret message: Plaintext word to be encrypted: H E L L O using a -2 transposition
